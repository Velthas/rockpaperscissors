# Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock
Initially a simple game of Rock Paper Scissors made to be played at the console. It is now updated with a graphical user interface and a few extra picks as seen in Sam Kass' own variant of the game, which adds two items to the list: lizard and spock. This project was done to practice event listeners and to some extent dom manipulation.

## The game
The game is an expansion on the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. Each player picks a variable and reveals it at the same time. The winner is the one who defeats the others. In a tie, the process is repeated until a winner is found.
